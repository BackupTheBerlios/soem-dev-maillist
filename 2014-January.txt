Subject: [Soem-dev] Likely error in oshw/linux/nicdrv.c
Message-ID: <0FA119D99613CD4D94F2FC8907EF2F0F9B8035C8@Exchange2010.hq-mtl.opal-rt.com>

Hi all,

I came across the Linux implementation of the network layer for EtherCAT and found this : (version 1.3.0, oshw/linux/nicdrv.c, line 184)

/* set flags of NIC interface, here promiscuous and broadcast */
ifr.ifr_flags = ifr.ifr_flags || IFF_PROMISC || IFF_BROADCAST;
r = ioctl(*psock, SIOCGIFFLAGS, &ifr);

It *really* looks like a bitwise OR was intended instead of a logical one.
Can someone confirm/disconfirm this?
